**Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2)** is a foundation model towards solving promptable visual segmentation in images and videos. We extend SAM to video by considering images as a video with a single frame. The model design is a simple transformer architecture with streaming memory for real-time video processing. We build a model-in-the-loop data engine, which improves model and data via user interaction, to collect [**our SA-V dataset**](https://ai.meta.com/datasets/segment-anything-video), the largest video segmentation dataset to date. SAM 2 trained on our data provides strong performance across a wide range of tasks and visual domains.

## Latest updates

**12/11/2024 -- full model compilation for a major VOS speedup and a new `SAM2VideoPredictor` to better handle multi-object tracking**

- We now support `torch.compile` of the entire SAM 2 model on videos, which can be turned on by setting `vos_optimized=True` in `build_sam2_video_predictor`, leading to a major speedup for VOS inference.
- We update the implementation of `SAM2VideoPredictor` to support independent per-object inference, allowing us to relax the assumption of prompting for multi-object tracking and adding new objects after tracking starts.
- See [`RELEASE_NOTES.md`](RELEASE_NOTES.md) for full details.
